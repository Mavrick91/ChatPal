## Running the application

To run the React application, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installing dependencies

Before you can run the application, you will need to install the required dependencies. To do this, run the following command from the root of the project:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the required packages listed in the package.json file.

### Starting the development server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. The development server will automatically reload the application whenever you make changes to the code, so you can see your changes in real-time.

### Building the production version

To build a production version of the application, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a production-ready version of the application in the build directory. You can serve the production version of the application using a static file server.
